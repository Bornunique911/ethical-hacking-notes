## Command and Control Framework Structure

* Command and Control (C2) Frameworks are an essential part of both Red Teamers and Advanced Adversaries playbooks. They help in managing compromised devices and aid in lateral movement.

```markdown
1. What is the component's name that lives on the victim machine that calls back to the C2 server?

2. What is the beaconing option that introduces a random delay value to the sleep timer?

3. What is the term for the first portion of a Staged payload?

4. What is the name of the communication method that can potentially allow access to a restricted network segment that communicates via TCP ports 139 and 445?
```

```

## Command, Control and Conquer

```markdown
