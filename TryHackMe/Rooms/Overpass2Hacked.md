## Forensics - Analyse the PCAP

```markdown
1. What was the URL of the page they used to upload a reverse shell?

2. What payload did the attacker use to gain access?

3. What password did the attacker use to privesc?

4. How did the attacker establish persistence?

5. Using the fasttrack wordlist, how many of the system passwords were crackable?
```

## Research - Analyse the code

```markdown
1. What's the default hash for the backdoor?

2. What's the hardcoded salt for the backdoor?

3. What was the hash that the attacker used?

4. Crack the hash. What's the password?
```

## Attack - Get back in

```markdown
1. The attacker defaced the website. What message did they leave as a heading?

2. What's the user flag?

3. What's the root flag?
```
