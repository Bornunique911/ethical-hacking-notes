## Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SSDLC)

* How Cloud changes AppSec:

  * Opportunities:

    * Higher baseline security
    * Agility
    * Isolated environments
    * Independent VMs for microservices
    * Elasticity
    * DevOps
    * Unified interface

  * Challenges:

    * Limited visibility
    * Increased app scope
    * Changing threat models
    * Reduced transparency

* AppSec phases:

  * Secure Design & Development - training, SSDLC, pre-deploy testing

  * Secure Deployment - code review, testing, vulnerability assessment, deployment

  * Secure Operation - change management, app defenses, ongoing assessment, activity monitoring

* SSDLC framework:

* Impact of cloud on SSDLC:

  * Risks change; more support from cloud provider

  * Large changes in visibility & control

  * Management plane and metastructure part of threat model

  * DevOps; managed via APIs

* Secure Design & Development:

* Threat modeling is done to get a view of all possible threats; one example is STRIDE (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privilege). The threat models are later mapped to their countermeasures.
