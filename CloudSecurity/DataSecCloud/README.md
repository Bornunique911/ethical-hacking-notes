## Cloud Data Storage & Data Moving to the Cloud

* Cloud data storage is based on abstraction/virtualization and does not use off-the-shelf tech.

* Major cloud data storage types:

  * Volume - virtual hard drive for VM

  * Object - resilient file storage via API

  * Database - relational, non-relational

  * Application/Platform - CDN, SaaS for file storage, etc.

* Management of data migrating to the cloud can include components such as DAM (Database Access Monitoring), CASB (Cloud Access Security Brokers), DLP (Data Loss Prevention) and URL (Uniform Resource Locator Filtering).

* CASB, or Cloud Security Gateways, has three key functions - Discover, Monitor and Protect.

## Securing Data in the Cloud

* Access controls are the most foundational security controls; includes management plane, public & internal sharing controls, and app-level controls.

* Granularity of access controls varies between platforms and services.

* An entitlement matrix is the documentation of authorizations.
