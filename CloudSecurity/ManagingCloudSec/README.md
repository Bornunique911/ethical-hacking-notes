## Governance

* Simplified hierarchy - governance -> enterprise risk management -> information risk management -> information security.

* Tools of cloud governance - contracts (relation between provider and customer defined), supplier assessments, compliance reporting.

* From governance to risk - governance -> risk tolerance -> supplier assessment -> contracts -> shared responsibilities model -> risk management.

## Managing Cloud Security Risk

* Types of Risk management:

  * Enterprise risk management - providing value to stakeholders; measure, manage and mitigate uncertainty.

  * Information risk management - aligning risk management to tolerance of data owner; subset of enterprise risk management; primary means of decision support on CIA of assets.

* Service model effects:

* Deployment model effects:

* Tradeoff considerations:

  * Lesser physical control over assets and lower need to manage risks the provider accepts.

  * More reliance on SLA, contracts and assessments (instead of testing); higher requirement to manage relationship and stay updated.

* Cloud risk management tools:

  * Request documentation
  * Review security program
  * Review legal, regulatory, industrial, contract obligations
  * Evaluate service based on context of info assets involved
  * Evaluate provider

* Governance and Risk recommendations:

  * Identify shared responsibilites of security and risk management based on chosen service and deployment model.

  * Deploy cloud governance framework as per industry best practices and standards.

  * Understand how contract impacts the governance framework.

  * Develop process for cloud provider assessments.

  * Cloud provider re-assessments should occur on an automated and scheduled basis.

  * Cloud provider should offer easy access to documentation, reports.

  * Align risk requirements to assets involved and their risk tolerance.

  * Create risk management and risk mitigation methodology to assess every risk in space.

  * Use controls to manage residual risks.

  * Use tooling to track approved providers based on asset type, cloud usage, management.
