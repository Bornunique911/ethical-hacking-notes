## Introduction to Infrastructure Security for Cloud Computing

* Macro layers (bottom to top) - Base Infra, Virtualized Infra, and Management Plane.

* Cloud security broadly covers components such as infra, hypervisors, network and management plane. Its advantages include:

  * Reduced capital expenditure
  * Better agility, resiliency
  * Better economic and security benefits

* Simplified Infrastructure Components:

* Securing cloud infrastructure:

  * Harden hosts
  * Harden infra services
  * Secure networks
  * Secure architecture
  * Harden management plane
