## Introduction & Cloud Architecture

* Resource pools are collections of physical resources such as Network, Compute and Storage. Building these involves two techniques:

    1. Abstraction (Virtualization) - Hypervisors, software-defined networking, storage abstraction.

    2. Automation (Orchestration) - Provision, Deprovision, Resize.

* Traditional virtualization - manual abstraction of resource pools; not elastic, and no self-service.

* Cloud computing - on-demand, dynamic, collection of resources and services, abstracted and automated; user-friendly.

* Benefits of cloud computing - Agility, Resiliency, Economics.
