## Introduction

* Information security (CIA triad) - "The protection of information systems from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction in order to provide confidentiality, integrity, and availability."

* Definitions:

  * Vulnerability - flaw, loophole or error that can be exploited.

  * Threat - event (natural or man-made) able to cause negative impact to organization.

  * Exploit - defined way to breach IT system security through a vulnerability.

  * Risk - situation involving exposure to danger.

* Considerations for a cybersecurity program:

  * Security program
  * Admin controls
  * Asset management
  * Tech controls

* Security:

  * Confidentiality
  * Authentication
  * Message integrity
  * Access and availability

## Actors and Motives

* Types of actors:

  * Hackers
  * Internal users
  * Governments
  * Hacktivists

* Motives include desire for money or a job, politicial motives or just to demonstrate capabilities.

* Types of security attacks:

  * Passive attacks - eavesdropping attacks, traffic analysis.

  * Active attacks - explicit interception and modification; types include masquerade, replay, modification, and denial of service.

* Security service - process or service provided by system for protection of a resource; security services implement security policies, implemented by security mechanisms.

* Security mechanisms - combo of hardware, software and processes that implement a specific security policy, using security services; can be specific or pervasive.

* Threats to a data communication system include destruction, corruption or modification, theft or removal or loss, disclosure and interruption of information services.

* Security architecture - Attack models:

  * Interruption
  * Interception
  * Modification
  * Fabrication
  * Diversion

* Malware - software to disrupt computer operations, gather sensitive info, gain unauthorized access or display unwanted advertising.

* Types of malware:

  * Virus
  * Worms
  * Trojans
  * Spyware
  * Adware
  * RATs
  * Rootkit

* Protection against threats:

  * Technical control - AV, IPS, IDS, UTM, updates.

  * Administrative control - policies, training, revision and tracking.

* Security threats:

  * Network mapping - scanning network and finding services; host scanners as countermeasure.

  * Packet sniffing - promiscuous NIC reads packets broadcasted.

  * IP spoofing - generate raw IP packets from application; ingress filtering can be used as countermeasure.

  * Denial of Service (DoS) - flooding malicious packets to receiver.

  * Host insertions - computer host with malicious intent is inserted in sleeper mode in network; as countermeasure, maintain accurate inventory of computer hosts.

* Phases of the Cyber Kill Chain:

  * Recon
  * Weaponization
  * Delivery
  * Exploitation
  * Installation
  * Command and Control
  * Actions on Objective
