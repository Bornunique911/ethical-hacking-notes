## Laptop Hardware

* Laptop computers tend to use solid-state drives, compared to desktop computers which prefer using hard drives. Hybrid drives are used as well.

* Similarly, memory modules in laptops are smaller - common ones are SO-DIMM (Small Outline Dual In-line Memory Module) and Micro-DIMM.

* The video cards are often built into the processor or the system board, and are non-upgradable.

* The power conversion for laptops is done on an external device that provides DC power directly into the laptop. AC adapters are used to convert AC into DC.

* The components used inside the laptop are designed for mobility and power management.

## Laptop Displays

* Laptops usually use LCD (Liquid Crystal Display). It is lightweight, cheap and requires low power. However, black levels are a challenge.

* OLED (Organic Light Emitting Diode) does not require backlight, unlike LCD. They are thinner and lighter. However they are costlier and consume more power.

* Wi-Fi antennas are also used in laptop displays.

* Backlighting can be either LED-backlit or fluoroscent.

## Laptop Features

* Smaller keyboards and function toggles are typical laptop features.

* Docking stations allow laptops to use external keyboard and mouse, or add additional functionality in general.

## Mobile Device
