# Mobile Devices

## Laptop Hardware

* Laptop computers tend to use solid-state drives, compared to desktop computers which prefer using hard drives. Hybrid drives are used as well.

* Similarly, memory modules in laptops are smaller - common ones are SO-DIMM (Small Outline Dual In-line Memory Module) and Micro-DIMM.

* The video cards are often built into the processor or the system board, and are non-upgradable.

* The power conversion for laptops is done on an external device that provides DC power directly into the laptop. AC adapters are used to convert AC into DC.

* The components used inside the laptop are designed for mobility and power management.

## Laptop Displays

* Laptops usually use LCD (Liquid Crystal Display). It is lightweight, cheap and requires low power. However, black levels are a challenge.

* OLED (Organic Light Emitting Diode) does not require backlight, unlike LCD. They are thinner and lighter. However they are costlier and consume more power.

* WiFi antennas are also used in laptop displays.

* Backlighting can be either LED-backlit or fluoroscent.

## Laptop Features

* Smaller keyboards and function toggles are typical laptop features.

* Docking stations allow laptops to use external keyboard and mouse, or add additional functionality in general.

## Mobile Device

* Designed for touch input, these are small-sized single-screened computers.

## Mobile Device Accessories

* Mobile device connections are supported by accessories such as Micro-USB, Mini-USB and USB-C plugs.

* Tethering is allowed by physically connecting a device to a phone to use Internet connection. WiFi hotspot does the same thing but it is wireless.

* Bluetooth is a type of PAN (Personal Area Network) and it offers high speed communication over short distances.

* Wired headsets are connected to the analog audio jack using TRRS (Tip-Ring-Ring-Sleeve) connector.

* A SD or a microSD card can be used in phones to increase the storage capacity.

## Mobile Device Connectivity

* Wireless networks used commonly on phones include cellular, WiFi and Bluetooth.

* IMEI (International Mobile Station Equipment Identity) and IMSI (International Mobile Subscriber Identity) are used to identify the device and the user, respectively.

* For older devices, retreiving mail used POP3 and IMAP, and sending mail used SMTP. For newer ones, commercial email providers are being used.

## Mobile Device Synchronization

* We can synchronize our data to the cloud, a desktop computer or to other appliances.
