# Hardware and Network Troubleshooting

## Troubleshooting

* Change control - Formal process for managing change to avoid confusion; requires plan, risk estimation, recovery plan and documentation.

* Troubleshooting process:

    1. Identify the problem
    2. Establish a theory
    3. Test the theory
    4. Create plan of action
    5. Implement the solution
    6. Verify full system functionality
    7. Document findings

## Troubleshooting Computer Hardware

* Unexpected shutdowns - heat-related issues; failing hardware.

* Lockups - check for activity; update drivers and software patches; low resources.

* Continuous reboots - bad driver or configuration; use Safe Mode; bad hardware.

* No power - check power supply; check fan power connection.

* Overheating - check cooling system.

* Loud noises - loose components; hard drive issues; fan problems.

* Intermittent device failure - bad install; bad hardware.

* Smoke and burning smell - electrical issues; disconnect power; bad components.

* Crash screens (BSOD) - document information to track problems.

## Troubleshooting Storage

* Disk failure symptoms - read/write failure; slow performance; loud clicking noise

* Troubleshooting disk failures - backup; check loose components, overheating.

* Boot failure symptoms - drive not recognised; OS not found.

* Troubleshooting boot failures - check cables; check boot sequence in BIOS.

## Troubleshooting Displays

* No video image - check connections; input selection on monitor; brightness controls; use VGA mode.

* Image quality problems - check cable pins; check native resolution; disable hardware acceleration.

* Artifacts (unusual graphics) - check adapter; turn off display.

## Troubleshooting Mobile Devices

* LCD display troubleshooting - check backlight; check with external display; connector issues.

* Input issues - sticking keys; pointer drift; update drivers.

* Power issues - replace battery; master laptop reset.

* Touchscreen non-responsive - reset mobile; remove and put back battery.

* App issues - stop app and restart; restart phone; update app.

* Short battery life - bad reception; disable unnecessary features; check battery usage; replace battery.

* Overheating - check app usage; avoid direct sunlight.

* Frozen systems - soft reset; hard reset; factory reset.

* No sound from speakers - check volume settings; re-install app.

* Swollen battery - buildup of gas; faulty battery; dispose immediately.

## Troubleshooting Printers

* Bad output - clean print-heads; check drum; low toner/ink; clean properly.

* Wrong color - replace/clean cartridge.

* Smudging issues - toner not fused properly.

* Paper jam - remove paper carefully; check tray, pickup rollers.

* Failed jobs - corrupted print jobs; check event logs.

## Troubleshooting Networks

* No network connectivity - ping loopback; ping local IP address; ping default gateway.

* Intermittent connectivity - check system tray; cable problems; bad interfaces.

* Slow transfer speeds - router issues; hardware issues with adapter; malware infection.
