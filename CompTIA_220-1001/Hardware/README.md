# Hardware

## Cables and Adapters

* Twisted pair copper cabling - balanced pair operation.

* Plenum-rated cable - traditional cable jacket (PVC); not flexible.

* UTP (Unshielded Twisted Pair) - no extra shielding.

* STP (Shielded Twisted Pair) - extra shielding protects against interference.

* Coaxial cables - two or more forms share a common axis.

* Optical fiber communication - transmission by light; no RF (radio frequency) signal.

* Multimode filber - short-range communication; cheap.

* Singlemode fiber - long-range communication; costly.

* VGA (Video Graphics Array) - DB-15 connector; analog signal.

* HDMI (High-Def Multimedia Interface) - video & audio stream; digital signal.

* DVI (Digital Visual Interface) - single and dual link; both analog and digital signals.

* DVI to HDMI - DVI-D & HDMI are electrically compatible; no signal conversion required and no loss of video quality.

## Connectors

* RJ11 connector - telephone connection; 6P2C (6 position, 2 conductor).

* RJ45 connector - modular connector; 8P8C.

* RS232 - serial communication standard; used as configuration port.

* BNC - coaxial cable connector; rigid and bulky.

* F-connector - cable modem.

* USB - USB 1.1/2.0, 3.0, USB-C

## Memory

* Common memory components include RAM, DIMM, SO-DIMM, DRAM, SDRAM and DDR-SDRAM.

* Multi-channel memory - use of multiple memory modules to increase performance.

* Parity memory - adds an extra parity bit.

* ECC (Error correcting code) - detects errors and corrects code.

## Storage

* Optical formats - small bumps read with a laser beam; CD-ROM, DVD-ROM, Blu-ray disc.

* SSD - non-volatile memory; no moving parts; fast performance.

* M.2 interface - smaller storage device; faster performance; different connector types.

* HDD - non-volatile magnetic storage; moving parts.

* SSHD - hybrid drives.

* USB flash drives - EEPROM; no power required to retain data.

* RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks) - different RAID levels.

* RAID 0 - striping; high performance; no redundancy.

* RAID 1 - mirroring; high disk utilization; high redundancy

* RAID 5 - striping with parity; efficient; high redundancy.

* RAID 10 (1+0) - stripe of mirrors; speed of striping & redundancy of mirroring; needs at least 4 drives.

## Motherboards, CPUs, and Add-on Cards

* Motherboard form factors:

    1. Physical size
    2. Basic layout
    3. Power
    4. Airflow

* Major motherboard types - ATX, micro-ATX, ITX, mini-ITX.

* Computer bus - communication path; can be used for system expansion.

* Expansion bus - bandwidth used to measure capacity; has its own clock; PCI (parallel) and PCI Express (serial) used.

* CPU sockets - motherboards matched with CPUs due to specific requirements; usually the largest component on the board.

* ZIF sockets - used for PGA (Pin Grid Array), which will plug into ZIF.

* LGA sockets - reverse of PGA.

* Storage drive interfaces - used for SATA and PATA connectors.

* BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) - software used to start computer; initializes CPU and memory.

* UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) - standard for BIOS; supports FAT and removable media; includes pre-boot environment.

* Case fans - cool air pulled through PC; layout of components is key.

* On-board fans - designed to cool an entire adapter card.

* Heat sink - dissipate heat through thermal conduction; the grid increases surface area.

* Passive cooling - fanless; controlled functions and low-power components.

* Liquid cooling - coolant circulated through a computer.

* Expansion cards - extend functionality of computer.
