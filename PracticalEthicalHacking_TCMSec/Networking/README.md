# Networking Basics

* The IP address and MAC address of the device can be viewed using ```ifconfig```.

* IP address - Layer 3; MAC address - Layer 2.

* The first three pairs in a MAC address act as identifiers, can be used in lookup to identify the vendor.

* In layer 4, TCP (connection-oriented) and UDP (connection-less) would be used as protocols.

* TCP three-way handshake - SYN packet is sent first, then SYN ACK is received, and then ACK is sent.

* Common ports and protocols -

  * TCP - FTP(21), SSH(22), Telnet(23), SMTP(25), DNS(53), HTTP(80), HTTPS(443), POP3(110), SMB(139,445), IMAP(143)
  * UDP - DNS(53), DHCP(67,68), TFTP(69), SNMP(161)
