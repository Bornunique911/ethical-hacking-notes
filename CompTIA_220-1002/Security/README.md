# Security

## Logical Security

* Logical security concepts:

    1. Microsoft Active Directory - centralized management; uses Organizational Units.
    2. Mobile Device Management (MDM) - set policies on apps, data, etc.
    3. Port security
    4. Certificate-based authentication
    5. Anti-virus and anti-malware
    6. Firewalls - host-based and network-based.
    7. Directory permissions
    8. VPN concentrator - Encrypt data traversing a public network.
    9. Data Loss Prevention (DLP)
    10. Access Control Lists (ACLs)
    11. Least privilege - permissions set to bare minimum.

## Malware

* Common types of malware:

    1. Ransomware
    2. Crypto-malware
    3. Trojan horse
    4. Spyware
    5. Keyloggers
    6. Rootkits
    7. Virus
    8. Worms
    9. Botnets

* Anti-malware tools:

    1. Anti-virus and anti-malware
    2. Windows Recovery Environment
    3. End user education
    4. Firewalls
    5. Secure DNS

## Security Threats

* Social engineering principles:

    1. Authority
    2. Intimidation
    3. Social proof
    4. Scarcity
    5. Urgency
    6. Familiarity
    7. Trust

* Social engineering types:

    1. Phishing
    2. Spear phishing (whaling)
    3. Impersonation
    4. Shoulder surfing
    5. Tailgating
    6. Dumpster diving

* Denial of service - force a service to fail by overloading; using design failure or vulnerability.

* DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) - launch army of computers to bring down a service; uses botnets.

* Mitigating DDos attacks - filter out traffic patterns; anti-DDoS systems.

* Zero-day attacks - vulnerability not detected yet.

* Man-in-the-middle attacks - using traffic redirection, ARP poisoning.

* Mitigating MITM attacks - use encrypted protocols like HTTPS, SSH.

* Brute Force attacks - keep trying the login process; slow; dictionary attacks; rainbow tables (doesn't work for salted hashes).

* Spoofing - pretend to be something you aren't; MAC spoofing, IP address spoofing.
